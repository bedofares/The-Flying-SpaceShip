## Project overview
It is a 2D Arkad single-player game. Side controller game that could be played using (spacebar or arrow up key) and it is a kind of
Infinite level type game with no end.
The game takes place in space and our main character is a flying spaceship. The space is full of a bunch of dangerous obstacles and
you must try to avoid them because that is your only way to return back to the earth. Crashing with the obstacles is going to stop
the game immediately and you will lose. The character moves from left to right with a suitable speed and it is going to stay at the
same speed the whole game. The fireballs are moving randomly in the opposite direction facing the spaceship from right to left at
a high speed in order to make it challenging and quite hard, you are free to move your rocket all over the canvas (up and down) to
avoid the fireballs. You will gain points for avoiding each obstacle and you are able to check your score while playing.
